[Music]
24:52
okay we're about to get started
25:04
come on okay
25:10
everybody for joining us um welcome to locals project s I am excited very excited a little bit
25:18
of adrenaline rush um to get for us to get deeper into the
25:24
discussion um this exhibition levels of process which has
25:32
a spice program on World building in the age of um I would like to welcome and thank our
25:38
speakers Leo Castaneda and Lauren Monson for this amazing multi-year progress
25:46
yeah this multi-year video game project has been going on for almost 15 years
25:53
uh 14 or 13 14 and some and
25:58
they've made this video game they've been working on it and they've created this prototype for this exhibition to
26:06
show with all of you as a collaboration with otro inventanio which is an art
26:11
House video game Studio that uses principles of sustainability and interdependence to expand world building
26:18
possibilities and basically the first of its kind in Miami so this is also really
26:23
special and thank you for inviting me to moderate you guys I provide and I'll
26:29
add a little bit of a context for the show to begin with then uh Leo will talk
26:35
and then Lauren will talk we'll probably do all of that in about 25 minutes then we're gonna open it up to
26:41
collaborators who've been also working on World building with AI or using Ai and Tech as part of their World
26:49
building processes and we're going to hear from them and then we're going to have a little bit of minutes so we'll have a conversation and all of that
26:55
should be about an hour and then we have an hour of drinks and discussion and experiencing the VR or the video games
27:01
the entirety of the show hope you enjoy it uh I am Lori Ross I'm an art critic that
27:09
recently I recently moved from uh from here I lived in Europe for the last 10 years I'm very new to Miami but
27:14
I have family here I am also Locust projects consultant for Grants and programs like this one
27:21
um I'm also the founder one of the founders of ciceroa magazine it's an art criticism and poetry publication
27:27
established in 2016 and we can talk about that at another point but I also wanted to let you know about that
27:34
um tonight we have like I said an hour-long program and you will get a chance to play the video games prologue
27:40
experience the exhibition which is very much designed to provide you a very rich
27:46
introduction to the evolution of the game from oil paintings and wall drawings of the artists to Virtual
27:53
Reality experiences bespoke Furniture like the one that I'm sitting in and the
27:58
carpets and uh this expressive large-scale projection versus that
28:03
you've only seen kind of half of it now but then you'll be able to see the whole thing once the presentation is done
28:09
I also encourage you to pick up the gallery notes uh but I just need to say
28:15
that this is a groundbreaking because it appends to traditional archetypes of games of bosses and
28:22
adversaries while also being a non-linear exploration of Science Fiction inspired levels it has a broad
28:29
range of interdependent abilities such as camouflage vibrational touch terraforming and Laser communication uh
28:37
I would like to hear more about those but I really think that it completely pushes the boundaries of independent
28:43
video game industry but also the use of AI and digital art this
28:49
um here's a little bit of my sense on artificial intelligence which I hope that will be part of our conversation
28:54
artificial artificial intelligence has become a fiercely debated topic ripe
29:00
with ambivalences fears and optimism abound from Terminator movies Skynet level judgment days to Nick Bostrom
29:07
speaking of AI as a form of collective modular intelligence for species being the suggestion being that the
29:14
implications of AI on our society are comparable to the Neolithic Revolution
29:19
10 000 years ago if we assume computers and by extension AI as primarily an aesthetic tool we are
29:26
seeing the development of a new kind of dynamic artist those artists who make fully aesthetic the social medium of an
29:32
increasingly interactive internet and video game culture has even fostered its own kind of avant-garde self-criticism
29:40
that can't help but recall Schiller's play Drive AI has firmly established itself here to
29:46
stay more generally in society and so now artists begin to mine AI culture and
29:51
rightly so the artists of the early 21st century that will be remembered are those that reflect an advanced culture
29:58
more generally For Better or For Worse its role in setting the next stage for a
30:03
new generation of artists was featured recently in the Atlantic with an article on the birth of a new aesthetic medium
30:10
expect AI to go the way of our whole just as good to know what's happening on mainstream media and like this is a
30:16
recession of like a big publication um there's also the course of history of purely aesthetic aesthetic interests in
30:23
AI for instance the original idea of experimental music
30:28
[Music] um
30:36
for instance the original idea of experimental music was the design of systems that are unpredictable
30:41
self-generating and seem to compose themselves for the past half century the most interesting strain of experimental
30:48
music has become an increasingly intertwined with algorithmic principles now
30:53
[Music] developing an explicit algorithmic music movements live coding modular synths Etc
31:01
the English electronic music duo autographer recently revealed that their music is no more of an artificial
31:07
intelligent collaborator than music per se well composer and Advent pop musician Holly Herndon is creating music with a
31:14
thinking AI that she has developed over the course of several years and so on she just released a very popular cover
31:21
of Dolly Parton's Jolene with the AI she has named Holly Plus
31:27
foreign at the end of the day
31:33
um and this for me is like a really good setup do we get sound
31:39
[Music]
31:48
the video vehicles are meant to illustrate correctly what's happening with the music but it just says I think
31:54
aesthetically there are linked to a lot of Leo's work and I'm going to be
31:59
showing you a few pieces that basically five artists and work that I think set
32:05
up okay with Dario's work being quite interesting
32:10
thank you [Music] no don't stop it
32:19
okay so as Contemporary Art struggles to create the masses Fringe elements begin
32:24
to claim culture but what is even rarer but inevitable but what is even rarer
32:29
but inevitable development is the marriage of AI with video games approximately 3.4 billion
32:36
people are Gamers across the world 3.24 billion sorry that's over 3 billion
32:42
people and it's growing last year was like 2.9 so like it's just growing exponentially every single year so this
32:48
Niche Pastime has become the biggest Mass phenomenon of our time these videos
32:54
in the words of Hans holrics video games are to the 21st century when movies wear
33:00
to the 20th century and what novels were literally I know
33:05
I know Lauren and Audrey montanario believe that levels and bosses will become a conceptual art Mass Market
33:11
video so before I end this introduction I want to briefly revisit various ways in which
33:17
artists have interacted with video games and made them into an art form this is far from a comprehensive list and I'm
33:24
not very getting into much detail but I just want to like offer some for thought on the history of digital
33:31
art particularly with regards to video games and Ai and enter into the internet
33:36
so these are works that I have experienced in one way or the other IRL and so those are the focus I'd like to
33:43
focus on owls that I've actually experienced so there might be important pieces missing but it's because I rather speak about artworks that I actually
33:49
have some sort of experience with um then you know and basically these are
33:56
five things that I consider important Jody
34:02
how many of you have learned earned yeah no Jody obviously quite a few maybe not okay uh Jody Pioneer were about in the
34:09
mid 19 th
34:15
um or at least web art that was based on a video game that was hacked uh the Jew
34:20
which is based on the Netherlands was amongst the first artists to investigate and subvert conventions of the internet
34:25
of computer games and a video games as well radically disrupting these systems
34:31
including the interfaces the commands the arrows the code Jody stages Extreme Digital interventions that destabilize
34:38
the relationship between computer technology and its users Untitled game was made just as a game
34:45
modifications mods began to gain widespread recognition as an art form unto itself Jody made the piece by
34:52
altering the graphics code of the computer game quick now I'm gonna play a
34:57
little bit of this as well [Music]
35:05
so their mods reduce the complex Graphics of the game and
35:10
um instead put a complex sound kit soundscapes on top of it
35:16
maybe a little a little forward it's like the start
35:22
[Music]
35:48
oh they have this very sort of minimal glitchy visual with some very complex
35:54
sounds a bit of it confusing it's a very enigmatic work
36:01
several videos [Music]
36:09
I'm not gonna play at all but I wanted to give you a sense of it um so Jody takes this principle to an
36:16
extreme by completely erasing every graphic element of the game and turning the monsters
36:23
the characters the backgrounds all to White and more the more psychedelic one
36:28
especially this one that I chose features a swirling black and white background uh very much like Albert and
36:33
Glade yard had an angry love child um uh
36:39
this is just like one of those very important works now I feel like can't have this conversation
36:46
without Corey archangel I also thought it was very important to
36:52
just briefly showcase these are shots of like two different video games first as
36:58
space invader from 2004. we're doing a little bit of a leap forward to the 2000s now and the Super Mario Bros
37:07
let me actually I'm gonna take off some oh yeah
37:14
[Music]
37:21
it's important [Music]
37:31
as a video game girls old it's content internal content begins to deteriorate
37:39
of course it's a conceptual framework behind the case and
37:46
[Music] it takes Super Mario game [Music]
37:51
that just leaves
37:57
basically oh
38:05
[Music] you're like is that intentional no it isn't
38:10
I wanted to show you show your clouds a bit of it and of course all these are clicked from
38:17
YouTube that you can also look up if you want to bring some comments um
38:23
okay so now Space Invaders are modification of atari's late 1970s shoot
38:28
up up some Space Invaders game it's instrumental in popularized immediately as for Halloween costumes
38:34
in the original version the players get to basically attempt to fend off attacking who are about to land on Earth
38:41
if the players are hit by an alien they're losing life in this early computer game created in color the 80
38:46
Invaders move from left to right along a horizontal line progressively moving downwards getting even closer to the
38:52
player position at the bottom of the in collaboration with Alec Galloway a member of radical software group
38:58
Archangel hack the games program quote in 2004 altering the game module so that in the modified version all the aliens
39:05
have been deleted except one which has instead inherited all the Invaders ammunition leaving the player
39:11
with little chance to survive so there's also with these video games
39:16
not only the sense of like hacking the games but also changing the fundamental resolution of the game
39:24
any thoughts so far
39:31
next to I just thought it would be really cool to showcase the evolution of things so
39:37
jumping forward uh to 2015 um Ian Chang is you know now we're
39:44
looking more of like contemporaries to Leo's own work this artist in particular
39:49
Ang Chang he creates um he's been developing a practice of digital simulations these are also super
39:55
large scale about the same size of the screen I she may be smaller but
40:00
they're really really large scale immersive projections his work explores opportunities offered by new
40:06
technologies and the way they influence the Consciousness and conditions of evolution so like they also are
40:12
basically developed with algorithms and they evolve themselves depending on certain kind of interactions that happen
40:18
so he is like kind of like the representative of this marriage of Art and artificial intelligence to create
40:24
these immersive simulations so msre is a three series The Emissary Trilogy it's
40:31
owned by Moma so they have some of the video is online that's why I can't show it to you here but
40:38
from I'm sorry for some question the second in the trilogy uh
40:43
of live simulations for this project Chang has been manipulate existing video game technology using algorithms to
40:50
create unique visualizations that unfold unpredictably and have no predetermined outcome The Works which are presented as
40:57
immersive video projections feature an interrelated cast of characters from robots to corgis and populates the same
41:04
Geographic locations across a long span of an imagined pre and post-human history
41:10
foreign I think also a component that relates to yours finally not exactly a video game but um
41:19
I really thought Simon Denny's work was important in the context of Leo's work particularly because of the way of
41:24
thinking about like yeah gaming culture appropriation of the cultural industry
41:30
and thinking about artistic installation as um and entering into this sort of
41:36
corporate world and adapting the artworks that he's creating as the critical and affirmative uh reflection
41:43
on what's already happening The Wider cultural industry the rider tech industry and bringing that back and
41:50
giving it new forms art and I thought when I walked into the space that was really obvious to me
41:56
um that like also right the work of Simon and language all of these not all of these are imagination but
42:02
simultaneously being an artist of my generation of the post internet generation which a lot of artists don't want to use anymore but I think he still
42:08
had a moment it was still quite significant um and yeah
42:13
that much also Leo's generation and okay so now we're gonna pass it on
42:19
to Leo oh my God
42:24
last but not least um this was really actually
42:31
um [Music]
42:39
immersive Technologies before I play the clip I'll actually read first Lu Yang is a Shanghai based
42:46
multimedia artist that has become a fortunate Contemporary Art World producing immersive video works again
42:51
the merch digital avatars video game and Anime Aesthetics with Buddhist Theology
42:57
and psychological inquiry so this is a little clip from the Great Adventure of
43:02
material world which resembles a conventionally gaming scenario where players have to pass through different levels and are confronted with paths in
43:09
order to defeat a boss it could be described as an accumulation of figures and scenarios encompassing
43:16
depictions of Hell superheroes deities and death that Liu young has been engaging as an artist for years and
43:23
basically has condemned and if it keeps reusing a lot of these characters this language these avatars so under the
43:30
guise of Pop Culture that's the other like huge element that's really important to Beyond's word um really it engages the central themes
43:37
of Mahayana and Buddhism so the video of peace commandeer is a religious texts
43:43
complete with literal quotation you get to see the Chinese and English version at the bottom when I played
43:50
um and in the end of the material will the Knight encounters themselves as an
43:55
opponent so the metal level that's eventually reached during the video game is where the game reveals itself as an
44:02
illusion sharing the faith of players in both their own perceptions and the existing concepts of what constitutes
44:08
The Real World the game is successfully completed with the achieving of such an awareness
44:13
okay that's young and I can play the video
44:22
foreign [Music]
44:42
[Music]
44:48
[Laughter] that's the whole purpose again
44:55
[Music] this game is really rocks and we were in an exhibition in Switzerland we also at
45:02
the house of electronics last year and blue Yang was in it with this game so it's great to experience in person
45:10
it's such a particular aesthetic work [Music]
45:18
okay I'll leave it there
45:23
there's quite a lot of gameplay videos on video partner works not that there's not a lot of stuff on YouTube but she
45:30
has she has a lot of it and they have a lot of it
45:37
okay so how's everybody doing good
45:42
um I'm gonna pass it on to Leo Leo was born in Cali Colombia in 1988. he's a
45:48
fine artist and video game designer living in Miami uh melding gaming painting virtual reality
45:54
drawing sculptural furniture wearables
45:59
work and renders surreal costume and social structures and anatomies
46:05
for 10 years because developed as a series on real engine I think this is very
46:10
important to create interconnected transmedia worlds that dissolve the boundary between analog and digital
46:16
today level and bosses culminates in an episodic video game and exhibition series expands interaction design
46:24
ation I want to introduce Lawrence since the audio presentation first but they're going to have a bit of we're back and
46:30
forth as they do being such collaborators in 2021 Monson Lauren Monson co-founded
46:36
Miami's first Outhouse video game studio ultimateario with someone was born in Miami in 1991. she
46:43
brings 10 years of experience scaling film festivals and cultural organizations such as third Horizon
46:49
raising Millions for Miami startup cultural institutions through Foundation governmental and corporate Partnerships
46:55
when Sandra is over seven he is seven years producing key Miami dependent
47:01
films that have gone on to Premiere at Sundance screen at MoMA when the Golden Bear the Berlin and secure distribution
47:08
from Criterion Collection the game as a game developer for work creating
47:13
participatory budgeting games was featured in the 2022 Allied media conference with restoring the future
47:20
okay thank you guys up to you [Applause]
47:30
microphone or uh thank you Lori for the introduction and thank you all for
47:36
coming uh thank you Locust for the opportunity to show here thank you Lauren for uh collaborating also ebony
47:45
Sabrina and I think we have Sabio in the live stream this exhibition has been the
47:51
first opportunity to work uh this exhibition has been the first opportunity to work uh as a team
47:57
Brittany as well wall text uh and it's been awesome to kind of
48:05
experience what it's like to go from an individual artist to like a gaming studio so
48:11
um just going to share a little bit of that that process uh of uh oh yeah of
48:17
being able to expand this project beyond what an individual could do and to into a whole uh collaborative experience
48:26
um including collaborating with the AI yeah yeah
48:32
okay so uh so yeah so levels and bosses is a it is
48:39
is aiming to be an episodic uh transmedia experience where uh it's
48:46
gonna be uh primarily a video game on PC and and uh you know relationship spending Playstation Xbox the ideal is
48:54
for it to be something that you go to a console and you play it and then there's these live exhibitions like what we see
49:02
here the correlate to the the episodes launching and
49:08
uh expanding into also having uh Outreach into different conferences so
49:14
let's say like a a Tech conference or a gaming conference or a film festival so like really figuring out like how to how
49:21
to go beyond the traditional Art Space and traditional art audience
49:27
um has been uh part of the idea and uh it uh as Larry mentioned it basically
49:34
gets that structure of progression systems and video games of going from one level to the next and expands it uh
49:42
and reimagines what the possibilities of a level on Boss could be through uh
49:48
worlds that are identifiably interconnected where you see the character looking like the landscape
49:54
looking like the technology and the and sentience is shared across uh all beings
50:02
to ideally you know like really be able to identify with various aspects of the
50:08
world but um wanted to show
50:19
a little bit of a parallel to what Lori was showing
50:25
Laurie wanted to show the art historical or like or the the art World perspective
50:31
of working with games but I wanted to give a little intro to at least some of the games that we're looking at in terms
50:37
of independent video games uh and and one Triple A video game that
50:43
that are that are pushing the the artistic landscape of video games and
50:49
hopefully the project that we're working on would be somewhere in between the Lou
50:55
Yang uh or the Archangel world and something like this so we have uh it's
51:02
probably the most known one here is journey by that game company uh uh which
51:08
is a california-based uh studio uh that when they're in at USC they got a
51:16
contract with Sony to release free games and that they basically broke ground and
51:21
what a uh independent video game could do in terms of of audience reach like it
51:28
was actually PlayStation PlayStation uh uh digitals uh uh like biggest selling
51:36
game um yeah Dear Esther uh around the same
51:41
time I think Journey's 2012 Dr around the same time it's a is a first
51:47
person poetry based experience so you're basically a poet on the island walking around and and you experience uh the
51:56
island uh in various ways um you have uh Hilux that was actually
52:03
made by a classmate of mine when I went to school in New York uh uh so it was a
52:10
very special experience to see that he was also getting into games but it's basically The Surreal Adventure
52:16
that um that where everything is made with Clay so if you if you download you'll see
52:23
that things kind of look like Lo-Fi 3D models but they're actually stop motion animated uh play sculptures and it's
52:31
basically this uh RPG series like role-playing game series that's amazing and speaking of role-playing undertale I
52:39
don't know if anyone has experienced undertale but it's also a role-playing game where you
52:46
have violence as a choice so basically uh um you can once you start playing the
52:54
game if anyone has played a Japanese RPG or RPG you enter this battle mode and in
53:00
the battle mode you have the option to attack but then it's the option of a flirt or joke and things like that and
53:08
and there's a pacifist mode and and it's basically become this uh really powerful
53:14
experience for lots of people that were in many video games the default interactions have a
53:22
have some kind of violence and anyways that's definitely a super inspirational
53:27
and it's also cool to see uh the reception of how people don't necessarily want to
53:33
if the default interaction is to use something destructive or violent it's not necessarily necessarily what people
53:40
want to experience and as a last example
53:46
one of the most violent games or violent series period which is the Dark Souls if
53:51
anyone has played Elden ring recently incredible uh experience of freedom and
53:57
exploration in the world where yes you have the violence as a primary interaction but but uh
54:04
it's really interesting to see people experience these games because they almost become uh religious experiences
54:10
because they're so difficult and and they offer this sense of Discovery through the through the level design
54:16
that is unparalleled because of the world's being super intertwined like not knowing where one is going uh a kind of
54:23
abstract-ish uh subjective narrative where you uh kind of are interpreting
54:31
the the symbols that are around you but they're not super clear like if if it was a TV show or something I guess there
54:38
could be a TV show that's also like that but uh but things are layered and interpreted so and you fail a lot you
54:45
learn mostly by failing a ton of times and keeping on crying but yeah but it's
54:50
been interesting as we developed the game to kind of look at uh you know this
54:55
kind of the the overall landscape to see okay like I mean not I mean to still do
55:02
something unique but also understand like what the lineage is uh that yeah includes uh yeah Corey
55:09
Archangel or Ian Chang et cetera but it's also coming from from this side from from the not necessarily the video
55:16
gamer the sorry the visual artist but games that have been experienced by
55:22
exponentially more people than than uh I mean unfortunately most likely than
55:28
let's say a Corey Archangel piece they're like no offense just just as far as yeah like if you look at the numbers
55:33
there Journey 2.5 2 to 5 million copies the undertale uh 3.7 million on Steam
55:41
Xbox three to three you know and these are in The Artsy games that have
55:46
uh you know like the niche of the niche is millions of people so we were joking
55:54
earlier that when a game doesn't do well it's around 20 000 copies sold and you compare that to the reach of the visual
56:00
art exhibition uh you know being able to merge the two can actually be a really proof background
56:07
um so um this does a quick uh run through
56:14
of some of the uh interactions that we're looking at um so um
56:21
basically uh the the levels and bosses encourages sustainability through its
56:28
gameplay uh uh not necessarily forcing it so in a way kind of like influenced by undertale
56:34
so so you have uh interactions such as camouflage vibrational touch
56:40
terraforming different ways of using light and intensities of light to pass
56:46
uh vibrational inputs to the world um you can glide you can uh you can you
56:53
have an awareness system that ranges from Deep listening and actually becomes camouflage so like so anyways we're
56:59
testing out a bunch of interaction types where you're really trying to to engage
57:05
and adapt to the landscape um uh yeah anything these different
57:10
observational and communication techniques to be able to shape the environments around you
57:20
and
57:32
um and basically the process has been going since uh 2009 when I was still in and uh
57:40
and my bachelor's program in New York at Cooper Union uh through a kind of
57:47
artist blog uh I began the series of working with the structure of gaming so
57:54
it started with uh and almost like in a way like kind of merging video game
57:59
principles with art principles so the first level which is this kind of primordial explosion was actually
58:07
thinking of uh Corey Archangel uh Super Mario clubs where you could jump on a
58:12
cloud or also just in Super Mario that you could jump on a club you can't do that in real life but in a video game
58:17
you just add collision and you can and it's an arbitrary situation of what you
58:23
can interact with and what you can interact with so uh that merged with uh
58:29
romantic landscape painting like Casper David Friedrich and and also uh uh yeah
58:36
like some Latin American sci-fi sorry um surrealism and abstraction mix in and
58:43
that was the first level like one of 12 original levels but then uh looking at
58:48
that is like okay well this is the variable like what's what are some other paintings that could be within that of
58:54
different worlds within that world than a comic book that you can see around uh
59:00
when you go back to the exhibit you can see it around um and and thinking of yeah how that
59:05
could expand into into real life exhibitions and and uh anyway I was only
59:11
like maybe 2013 when I started working with the digital program so it was more like the the hope of the digital at
59:18
first and then all right YouTube let's go and learn unreal let's go and learn uh different Autodesk programs but uh
59:26
yeah this kind of shows a little bit of the the process um
59:31
and I mean for those that are in the live stream this is just an image of the exhibition that that you're in so uh
59:40
yeah uh yes after uh 13 years 13 13 almost 14 years of
59:48
working on the project we have this Exhibition at Locust uh it's called ramientes levels and bosses like in
59:54
Spanish for the tools so where you basically um see the underlying systems within the
1:00:01
game of how the energy system came together that has worked with Lauren
1:00:06
like super hard on like uh especially through Laurens like language and economics background to like really hone
1:00:13
in on um like the exchanges of how this uh Energy System would work you have in the
1:00:21
background this uh prototype for the pause menu as a as a home uh and the
1:00:27
Prototype of this kind of game conference Booth as a art exhibition
1:00:32
um and then uh in terms of uh AI uh thanks
1:00:39
to uh the programmer we're working with uh the Glad scientists or also Sabio he
1:00:45
he got us a early key to Dolly uh and it was it's been amazing to to
1:00:52
basically uh exponentiate the amount of World
1:00:59
building that one could do I mean drawing is is great and language is
1:01:04
great but with with the AI like really trying to understand how to recreate the
1:01:11
aesthetic of this kind of sci-fi Latin American surrealism meets
1:01:16
uh Alien worlds through words has been amazing uh yeah and I'm sure you're all
1:01:23
familiar with the tools already of you know you just type in the sentence and you can give a style of and it's been a
1:01:31
nice reflection of some of the early works like being like uh Quarry Archangel style Super Mario clouds in
1:01:37
the style of romantic paintings but then nowadays it's like like this uh the image on the left uh
1:01:46
was prototyping the pause menu so it was something like Ocarina Zelda Ocarina of Time uh pause menu in the style of Latin
1:01:56
American surrealism uh meets uh Amazonian malokas which are these uh
1:02:02
multi-family homes so like really trying to understand the like the influences and the Essences of the work has been
1:02:08
really great and uh on the right you have like there's some wearables in the
1:02:14
room and and then with the AI it was also like uh Dazzle camo uh yeah I think there's
1:02:22
Dazzle camo meets uh poison dart frog Poncho in the style of video games
1:02:29
[Music] fashion runway Metal Gear Solid or
1:02:34
something so so like really anyways it's been pretty awesome to experiment with that um yeah I mean
1:02:42
yeah you can just run through a few images so yeah some some level
1:02:47
designs some uh expanded uh chair design so so we're
1:02:55
the Glorious could start covering and I know it's been really cool to have
1:03:02
this tool as a way to exponentially build like yeah like everyone's gonna be able to
1:03:09
to have but uh yeah and then and then the the next level is like
1:03:14
figuring out with all this content how to bring it back into the feedback loop of analog and digital that's been
1:03:20
happening with the game so so paintings made from this texture is
1:03:26
made of these going back into digital objects like basically really looping into to be like a endless cycle between
1:03:34
the computer and and the you know like the end and the person and the team
1:03:42
so that's um speaking of seeing we'll continue with Lauren
1:03:49
two years ago we got together and launched a fine art video game Studio
1:03:55
that uses principles of sustainability and Community to expand World building possibilities and games and this has
1:04:02
really influenced the way that we use our tools also right from AI to technology as we develop the game uh you
1:04:10
know eventually we hope to be a video game collection and Production Studio that helps cultivate local talent to
1:04:16
building those local Regional pan Caribbean pan Latin American video game economies here in our community too
1:04:23
um on building sort of impossible projects um so as we look to some of the things
1:04:30
we've done where you can see that influence of mutualism and Community this is actually the first game that our
1:04:37
studio uh mocked up during a game jam with Cali Colombia and here you're going
1:04:44
through and you're feeding a sculptural garden different seeds water and plants
1:04:50
and nourishing them by listening to their needs so the sort of ethos of mutualism to navigate these foreign
1:04:57
alien Landscapes is pretty Central to a lot of the work that we do thank you
1:05:02
Lord um and this this is an example actually of Niagara flock ing system that we're
1:05:09
using right now uh we're prototyping an element for the first level where you
1:05:14
can actually see the connection between um what's all the different actors in
1:05:19
the world to help guide you and understand the relationships between the player environment and different uh
1:05:27
sentient actors in there um so this is one example of a tool that
1:05:32
we're you know continuously kind of workshopping to make the puzzles for the first level better and so that you
1:05:39
visually manifest the interconnections between all the players and the worlds
1:05:44
around you the hope being that if you can identify with the landscape if they
1:05:49
landscape looks like you if you can see all the connections between it does that actually begin to change how you
1:05:54
interact with the world around you um and so on the back end
1:06:01
um I think thank you Laurie um this is another example of how we're
1:06:08
using Ai and Technologies like Unreal Engine 5 blueprints um to manifest that interconnection you can see uh the
1:06:15
different abilities from vibrational touch to electromagnetic illumination and movement we all have kind of
1:06:22
accounted there based off of however you're whenever you're colliding or interacting with the different entity in
1:06:29
the world um so what you saw on the back end this is the what you saw in the front end this is the back end
1:06:36
um and then you know as little was pointing to also uh aesthetically that same ethos of mutualism and these
1:06:44
different labyrinths of collective belongings sort of mixed in with our regional landscape elements these are
1:06:51
some of my personal dollies um really inspired a lot by our our foliage down here and the different
1:06:58
ways if you look at a banyan tree or a family on tree you can see those particles that are also colliding and
1:07:06
interacting each other in really mutualistic ways that through those feedback loops we can also continue to
1:07:11
bring into the Digital World um so yeah these are also inspired by these
1:07:17
are mutualistic Breezeway blocks actually inspired by tide pools um
1:07:24
I guess you know like when we're thinking about these Neo primordial worlds and different building blocks and pattern Wrecking
1:07:36
the gameplay overall that you'll see in the prologue in the first chapter is there's actually these actors that are
1:07:41
singing to you what their needs are um some want touch some want lights and somewhat dance and they want those at
1:07:48
various intensities um so when we're thinking about different patterns like like these that you can generate um to then look you
1:07:56
know as you saw those particle systems kind of flocking right the more you listen in the game you'll be able to see
1:08:01
those interconnections and patterns like these might emerge that will tell you like hey I want to be touched with
1:08:07
moderate intensity or I want some flash you know and different patterns to
1:08:13
harmonize with awesome these are some of those examples of future levels that we also hope to
1:08:20
create or environments for different games these are based off of jacuzzis and
1:08:26
Collective belongings and the hope is that yeah we could convert these into 3D
1:08:36
and just really facilitates the sort of rapid prototyping of those
1:08:41
yeah we can Breeze through these some more examples these are carilla Del cobre inspired
1:08:50
different forms of conflict resolution as well like a lot of the times I'll ask
1:08:55
the AI to mirror itself or different sort of post-human Interest species uh
1:09:01
hugs or forms of happiness and really try to you know continue to build the
1:09:06
abstraction and surrealism and connection all through there
1:09:13
and yeah I think this is where it would be really great to invite some of our collaborators in and also talk about
1:09:20
their process how they're using Ai and their World building I know we have one of our collaborators
1:09:27
here Edney Gene Joseph incredible
1:09:36
is how is AI influencing your practice and how you're you're thinking about
1:09:42
your tools [Music]
1:09:47
is a weird um a weird privilege to have as an artist
1:09:53
as it is basically the steroid to your creative capacity
1:09:59
you can come up with more ideas than you could have in a day so like
1:10:04
my I'm just trying to find the balance of when I should stop
1:10:10
generating and uh when I just when I should start considering
1:10:16
because that's where the art is is where you can keep considering it considering but AI is a very cool um
1:10:26
tool it's nothing that is any different than a paintbrush
1:10:31
to me it's just uh it produces more
1:10:38
so yeah uh I've uh I guess to talk about my like what I've
1:10:43
done specifically with AI I I came up with this um idea to generate basketball cards
1:10:51
to see what it would do with the idea of hey what is there like my prompt was
1:10:57
what is the rarest basketball card or you know vintage basketball cards
1:11:04
um and I came up with 960 of those um [Music]
1:11:10
and their physical version I had to I had to generate it was more than 960
1:11:16
actually it was like a thousand and something you know just figuring out what I liked
1:11:22
putting them into a folder uh and then kind of being anti-algorithm AI because
1:11:28
I could have left them in my folder in my computer but I instead chose to make it a thing to cut them and make
1:11:36
them into real cards so I guess I was trying to be artist again
1:11:41
instead of a computer so that's uh that's what I'm doing
1:11:50
[Music] but you have like all these distortions
1:11:55
that happen with the AI and like combining all the source imagery of the
1:12:01
different thousands of them yeah yeah yeah yeah like it's yeah the thing with AI too is
1:12:07
that it doesn't really understand what is trying to make most of the times exactly so faces get weird uh places get
1:12:14
weird all the nouns get weird um so you know it's
1:12:21
it's it's I think we do have the technology to make it possible to make something perfect but we are just making
1:12:28
that so we're just slowing that down so that we're not making photo realistic
1:12:35
you know images of things I could definitely hurt us so right now is this is a good middle
1:12:41
ground uh in the creative space of AI
1:12:49
of course of course see you guys somewhere else
1:12:58
taking it [Music]
1:13:04
yeah that's the fun part about working in a studio working with so many different collaborators everybody gets
1:13:10
to bring their perspective to how they're managing these tools it's cool right here
1:13:16
are you sure no no okay
1:13:22
hi I'm Sabrina um I've worked with uh Leo and Lauren
1:13:27
for a hot minute now my experience with AI is more of like in
1:13:33
a film perspective um how AI has helped me is um we're in a
1:13:40
very new and volatile generation of tech where it's morphing at like an
1:13:47
exponential rate and um I think a really great thing about that is the democratization of
1:13:54
what we have access to and um like what Lauren and Leo had referenced before is
1:14:01
the possibility of like Pan American pan Caribbean game design in Miami
1:14:08
and I see that translation in films for example I went to Florida State and I
1:14:16
studied film over there and um a huge barrier to making films is
1:14:22
having a crew the money for equipment getting licenses to film in a certain
1:14:29
location but if you're working with like you know a software that creates
1:14:35
simulations like Unreal Engine and you're working with AI you kind of get
1:14:40
to streamline a lot of those jobs like I know right now the automation of a lot
1:14:46
of jobs is scary but it could also lead the way to
1:14:51
[Music] um a lot more possibilities for people to take on to have greater power to create
1:14:57
like bigger projects for example I've been able to kind of condense the idea
1:15:03
of communicating ideas through storyboarding through AI so like yeah I
1:15:10
could draw it but now I can get a more precise like I want the lighting to look like this or like I can make the
1:15:17
composition very specific and communicate very complicated ideas while saving my time so in a sense it gives me
1:15:26
more power as one person to thrive in that industry versus not having AI
1:15:36
that's all I got okay absolutely yeah
1:15:42
I'll trade yeah even one of the things Leo and I talk about too is with Dolly right now
1:15:48
there's static images but there's already generators that by through a prompt can already pull out video for
1:15:54
you based off of what you've typed and 3D models calling coming very soon yeah
1:16:01
um is there anybody else I know I know there's other people in here who use AI
1:16:07
in their practice and would love to hear from them too um
1:16:34
my name is we both work in AR AI art
1:16:41
um I started like around 2018 and we both then started taking courses during the pandemic to learn about this stuff
1:16:48
but echoing the like 3D AI art generation or AI music
1:16:55
like like there's a few models doing video now and I think it's really cool
1:17:00
to see Leo's work uh we both went to the same school and stuff so really amazing I remember you
1:17:06
talking about like level one as a painting and then now immersive installation it's super cool
1:17:13
on how using AI to like imagine further the levels so
1:17:19
I can't wait to see what you'll do with sound 3D and and even video right
1:17:26
um so yeah I don't know I guess I'm really open to imagining what what's
1:17:31
happening in like as some of you said too like how fast is happening or how where should we be
1:17:37
uh just about creating with these things it's pretty pretty outstanding and even
1:17:43
from like 2018 like it's gotten a lot faster in this year alone like there's
1:17:51
just a lot more papers coming out and open source models and
1:17:57
it's in Photoshop and I think Tick Tock has like an AI art thing they started trying with so
1:18:05
you know you'll have influencers that are purely generative and it's getting wild yeah
1:18:11
so I think a big [Music]
1:18:19
for the work ultimately but also sort of the scene is very collaborative a lot of
1:18:24
stuff a lot of the works that I showed were done in collaborations with other people um can you guys talk about that and
1:18:31
that'll be so if you can sing as well a world collaboration and sort of maybe
1:18:39
this component of like how fast things are moving
1:18:44
or other components of collaboration that have become really important in getting into this work
1:18:51
um yeah um
1:19:05
amazing if AI base work and it's just interesting to see the the AI work looks
1:19:12
so similar to the pretty AI work it's like everybody ends up planning their own style almost like
1:19:18
we desire the images that we make already and it's just like any sets just
1:19:24
makes them exponential and then it's about filtering but uh yeah in terms of the collaboration
1:19:32
um yeah like most uh video games or more technology projects are done in teams so
1:19:39
it's the visual arts have this kind of singular artists situation but
1:19:45
but yeah the in order to be able to make something like an independent video game
1:19:51
uh you know we're marrying that structure that there's only so far that I could get with audio without being a musician
1:19:59
there's better musicians not only so far uh
1:20:04
the you can get with the furniture design so uh surface system air filter
1:20:13
met through some friends amazing sculpture fabricator and helped to make the chair
1:20:19
um you know let me and and Brittany amazing graphic
1:20:28
designers uh elevated the graphic design of the exhibit with the wall text and
1:20:33
the logo and and it's yeah it's cool to see like how the the back and forth works and
1:20:40
then yeah um um we're having a little bit of trouble
1:20:45
with the zoo but we should be able to bring him in soon yeah you know that ethos of collaboration is so Central to
1:20:52
any media project the National Endowment for the Arts actually came out with the study it was last year if not the year
1:20:59
prior where they talk about the ways that Grassroots media artists are innovating new ways of collaborating
1:21:06
um and I think that's especially true for Miami and places that are under resourced where we're constantly having
1:21:12
to figure out how to hustle to make our projects and there were not only pooling labor
1:21:18
and Equipment but we're also figuring out new ways for how to get this done whether that's in collaboration with new
1:21:24
tools or in collaboration with each other um and so that understanding of media
1:21:29
arts as vehicles for civic cultural and economic Innovation is something that
1:21:34
really infuses the sort of ethos of our project and of our studio you can you
1:21:40
know all over the place Grassroots media artists are innovating that whether um Jason over at access Labs who's
1:21:47
pioneered whole new ways of even relating to our environment and accessibility to do do the physical
1:21:54
places we go to have ramps have other access features that can make it livable
1:21:59
for everybody to just walk into and you can rate that on an app to use of Mary's
1:22:05
sort of hacking on paper installations that are these giant Monumental sort of
1:22:10
uh exhibits where you see Google Chavez's personal emails there for you to consider right they're these new
1:22:16
forms of speaking culturally that are being innovated by our collaborations with HF with AI and with each other
1:22:25
I want to open it up to the audience now we've sort of set up like triangulation between my presentation and Contemporary
1:22:32
Art practices or recent art practices that we're dealing with video games
1:22:37
um or with different components of uh Contemporary Art practice that I think you know our precedence for this work
1:22:44
but we also talk about AI technology and what's happening there but also with the video game industry so that's kind of
1:22:50
like this triangulation that we have uh with with the work in levels of bosses
1:22:56
so I'm curious and that's kind of like the goal of tonight I was like to be able to sort of understand like these
1:23:02
are different scenes with different backgrounds that often don't speak to each other and it's kind of hard to get them to speak to each other notoriously
1:23:09
hard to get them to speak to each other um so any questions comments from the audience
1:23:17
go ahead speak loudly too
1:23:26
[Music]
1:23:32
well you have your own profile so so
1:23:37
um so it's like it's like a Instagram almost like so yeah
1:23:45
oh yeah I was also wondering what is
1:23:52
yeah which is now open so it's widely
1:23:57
available it costs about 10 cents a search nowadays um there's also stable
1:24:03
diffusion it's a little bit cheaper but yeah they all kind of charge for their computational
1:24:10
storage yeah but uh it depends I've seen it depends on the aesthetic that you
1:24:16
have I've seen some people were stable diffusion or mid-tierney work better further what they want to do but for what we
1:24:23
want to do Valley has been incredible it feels like like it can handle more of the the stacking the terms
1:24:31
uh so like kind of overloading it where some AI is kind of you
1:24:39
know usually simplify but um but that those just are
1:24:48
are a little bit better rendered and but yeah it does end up being like your
1:24:54
own profile on all of these things
1:25:12
and they're just different kinds of models recommending these things While others
1:25:21
do things like stack the you you can
1:25:27
like connect one model to another so it gets many Tools in a way
1:25:36
yeah all the questions from the other yeah over here so as artists you guys are only gonna drop speaking to us just
1:25:42
like that okay all right so as artists do you guys only view AI as a tool to
1:25:48
help you create or do you see it as something that's going to completely take over like a creative process
1:25:53
as an artist like you know because personally like there's there's a process you go through when you create stuff with your hand right
1:25:59
there's there's like a it's like a thing all right so if you're just typing in words into an AI program it's it's just
1:26:06
like I feel like as an artist you might get a little lazy you know just like type things in and it creates whatever
1:26:11
you wanted to create but I wanna I wanna know if you guys just view as a tool or
1:26:16
something that like later on you're just gonna do that only like just create things through AI only
1:26:27
I mean for me it's been so liberating I come from a literature and economics
1:26:34
[Music] but like everything to me it's a whole new visual language it's a whole new
1:26:41
world I get to share with myself and my collaborators and um I think for that you know it's
1:26:48
not necessarily taking over but you're here to stay and continue adopting for sure
1:26:58
again I mean it's going to take people as well for sure
1:27:04
he is an artist said I'm scared
1:27:11
I like the torture of the community friends you
1:27:16
know but whatever that's just me yeah yeah I'll say I would say test it
1:27:23
but it's also
1:27:32
also make 900 images yeah and then and then you might remember something but
1:27:37
some kind of get lost in like a dream like state of not having the time investment but then you can go back in
1:27:44
then and like you know like expand that image have that image be the basis of a
1:27:51
composition for a 3D rendered space or have a be the basis of a painting or
1:27:56
have it uh Inspire something that you're right you know like yeah I mean that's the positive aspect
1:28:03
of it of course there's the the expanded Google version of it that is
1:28:10
if someone is yeah yeah there's extra understanding how our minds work through
1:28:15
it because it's like a very personal Google search but yeah
1:28:22
you back um do you ever feel like
1:28:30
it was like a job chance
1:28:36
yeah that's why I brought up otter here at the beginning the musician the experimental musician because like it
1:28:41
was an early experiment on particularly using music as a major meaning for experimentation of the
1:28:47
unexpected with the music that was like basically Frodo algorithmic it was like
1:28:53
from like 50 years ago and that's coming out of like a post job page for sure yeah 100 uh chance because you're
1:29:02
relying on on the database and like what past images people have uploaded to that
1:29:08
or sorry or uploaded to the general internet but hundreds of millions of images and and
1:29:15
how the bias of the AI is gonna grab different words and give them extra
1:29:20
weight or not so yeah definitely it's very addicting because it does feel like
1:29:26
a slot machine of content
1:29:32
wait a new speaker please yes
1:29:42
speaking to like Lauren calling it a language a new language like for you
1:29:47
does it feel limiting or strange at all that you're speaking to it with words
1:29:52
and it's only coming back with images and can you can you upload images
1:29:58
to it you can okay
1:30:03
for humans you can scale out to create you know more the view of the scene that
1:30:09
has already been rendered that's sort of the more macro and like that there's each software has like infinite infinite
1:30:15
tools that you can kind of collaborate with the images that it generates to make them more custom or tailored to
1:30:21
what you want I think even speaking to the role of chance like you can make variations on an image that just
1:30:28
slightly vary what you already it was already been generated and but it does
1:30:34
almost no one I joke it feels almost like Instagram sometimes like the healthier version of Instagram because
1:30:39
your brain is like getting those little micro uncertainty hits of like okay what's going to be generated what's
1:30:44
coming back to me um but it kind of yeah I don't I don't know if that answered your question Caroline
1:30:55
[Music] tried it but uh the upliving of the image doesn't
1:31:00
look as good as remaking the the art aesthetic through its influences
1:31:07
through like the stacking of a yeah yeah like like in those first
1:31:13
levels like romantic landscape painting meets video games like it'll get closer to the desired
1:31:21
aesthetic who works than through the image I guess burnout
1:31:26
with with the current experience maybe one day we'll be able to upload
1:31:31
like a physical object like just scan the object into Dolly already I mean even yeah you know what it is
1:31:40
we've gone over the hour We're small enough Cooper I think that you know there's wine there's beer there's even
1:31:46
snacks to have what we also wanted to make sure is that there was an hour presentation and then more with live DJ
1:31:51
I think there's a one question in the chat oh yeah
1:31:57
[Music]
1:32:06
so metaverse question yes
1:32:14
well yeah I mean the metaverse if there's a
1:32:20
the if there's digital art as a precursor to part of games and
1:32:28
the precursor to nfts and the pre you know like it's a very sensible jump of
1:32:34
virtual world that has uh a layer of uniqueness to different
1:32:42
things and and like or what people talk about the interoperability of being able
1:32:47
to bounce around different uh universes uh yeah I mean I'm interested in
1:32:53
like it would be awesome to have this whole uh levels in bosses universe as a
1:32:58
metaverse yeah like I'd be into it for sure yeah yeah yeah that you have a
1:33:04
chair and then you scan the chair and you enter a virtual world and then that links back to the game and then a link
1:33:11
to a VR space that links to a wallpaper in your room and and they're all kind of
1:33:17
identifiably interconnected worlds like one of the thematics of that we're really pushing like the
1:33:24
uh yeah definitely open to it as far as the current version of the metaverse
1:33:30
it's a longer conversation about nfts that I that I have uh many layers of
1:33:36
thoughts and two I don't know if we have enough time but whole separate panels but uh
1:33:42
It's Curious to have VR chat with exponentially more people
1:33:48
not be considered a metaverse or fortnite be considered like Proto metaverses but then the central land
1:33:54
with 50 people a day is a metaverse because there's land ownership but the
1:34:01
the virtual spaces like VR chat where you people go and have and are with
1:34:06
friends and then they open up a portal and go to another world like those are way more advanced in the in the feeling
1:34:12
of a metaverse than the the the
1:34:17
spaces that are claiming to be metaverses because of the ownership of
1:34:22
scarcity quality so I think that's something that has to be figured out like if if uh in unlimited worlds
1:34:31
uh like if it is great to have scarcity or not it is scarcity something that
1:34:38
pays us as artists because it gives extra value to the digital asset and then and then uh
1:34:45
we you know can live from digital assets so I think that's awesome that's uh the precursor
1:34:52
of that is uh turbo squid or or uh the unreal-ended marketplace where you can
1:34:58
buy digital assets that are unlimited but we have here it's like giving that
1:35:05
art world the art World framing of the limited-ness into the digital
1:35:11
um anyways I could keep going on that but but uh yeah definitely open to it but
1:35:19
open but skeptical but it's definitely Yeah the more it builds and the more that there's AI like giving people the
1:35:26
ability to even type Virtual Worlds into existence uh as a evolution of Dali and
1:35:32
the 3D modeling of AI software is like uh yeah it's definitely like many people
1:35:39
are saying that and 5 10 plus years you'll be able to type video games into existence or virtual
1:35:45
world so that as a metaverse is pretty interesting like that we will all be
1:35:51
able to create worlds as part of our uh you know like weekend plans
1:35:59
want to come over here
1:36:08
very soon hang out have some drinks have some food and let's keep the
1:36:13
